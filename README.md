## Why this stack?

> Before reaching this stage, we went through [this process](https://github.com/younghyun-bae/ui-syn-berlin),

This stack was carefully selected **to create a modern, scalable, and developer-friendly mobile application**. Each technology plays a unique role in ensuring the app is **robust, maintainable, and user-friendly**.

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev): offers cross-platform compatibility. Develop for iOS and Android using a single codebase with native-like performance. I'm familiar with React.js as a frontend developer.
- [Expo](https://expo.dev): Simplifies setup, testing, and deployment with built-in APIs for push notifications, camera, and more. High-performing routing.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com): Provides authentication, real-time database, and serverless backend support, reducing complexity, letting us focus on the app’s features and user experience.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org): Enhances code quality and readability with type safety, catching errors early.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com): Modern, scoped styling with dynamic theming for a clean, maintainable UI, helping make the codebase more semantic by allowing to assign meaningful names to components, even in React Native, where tags like `View`, `Text`, and `Image` often repeat.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io): Ensures reliable and fast testing with support for unit, integration, and snapshot tests.

Together, this stack offers a fast, efficient workflow and a solid foundation for building scalable mobile applications.

## 🎡 A Community for Berlin’s Creative Souls

> This project is built with the hope of turning a dream into reality: to connect people, spark ideas, and make Berlin’s creative scene even more vibrant. Whether you’re here to find collaborators, promote your skills, or just meet like-minded folks, welcome aboard!

### 🧙🏻‍♀️ Behind Story

Berlin is a city full of freelancers, creators, artists, and entrepreneurs—a hub for young artists and technologists shaping their unique paths. As the world moves towards a future where people wear multiple hats and their personal brand becomes their profession, Berlin stands out as the perfect place to foster these ideas.

When I first moved here with no connections, I spent a lot of energy stepping out of my comfort zone, searching for collaborations, and finding people who inspired me. I realized the value of a community that brings together people in similar situations. Berlin, with its unique vibe, felt like the ideal city to make that happen.

During my time here, I’ve collaborated as a developer, social media strategist, graphic designer, and even a fashion & beauty model—learning so much from diverse partnerships. Talking with friends juggling different careers, we often shared stories of struggles and dreams. That’s when the idea for this project was born—a service to help solve those common frustrations and create meaningful connections.

On a personal note, this project is also a chance for me to combine my eclectic background and my knack for building genuine relationships. I want to connect people in ways that make the world a little more vibrant.

## 🤳🏻 What can users do here?

- Sign up, log in, and manage their accounts: Facebook, Google, or good old email—whatever works for you. You can also log out or delete your account if you decide to move on.

- Create and edit profiles: Your profile gets saved in the talent list, making it easy for others to find you and start a chat.

- Discover events and join the conversation: Check out promoted events, write posts, and share your thoughts in the community threads to connect and exchange information.

I plan to integrate AI APIs to provide personalized support based on the gathered information. Working solo can lead to psychological isolation, so the goal is to offer guidance.

As the platform handles personal data, ensuring strong security, legal protection, and safeguards against negative interactions will be key to maintaining a safe and supportive space.
